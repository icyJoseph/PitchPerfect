# Pitch Perfect

Build as part of the iOS Developer Nanodegree

The app has two views. On the first view you can record your voice, by pressing the record button.

When you are done, press the stop button, and you'll be taken to the second view. In the second view
you can playback your recording, by chosing of the 6 effects:

- low pitch
- high pitch
- fast playback
- slow playback
- echo
- reverb

You may stop the playback at any time. The playback also stops if you navigate back to the initial view.
